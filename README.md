# batshit

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/batshit.png?mini=true)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/batshit)

That `bats` is *the shit* for UNIX-shell-programs-testing should be well known.
Testing-with-`bats` should be a hit too.

## Why

I like to test cli scripts with [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats),
however I write my scripts as node_modules and bats isn't published thus yet.

This should offer the latest
[bats release](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats/releases) - currently at
`v0.4.0`.

The goal is to neither clone nor install it - just depend on, and test with.
