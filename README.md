# batsies

A plural, diminutive `bats` for npm.

# Why

I like to test cli scripts with [bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats),
however I write my scripts as node_modules and bats isn't published thus yet.

This should use the latest
[bats release](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats/releases) - currently at
`v0.4.0`.

The goal is to neither clone nor install it - just require and test with.
